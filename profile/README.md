# Easy Model Fusion Toolkit

This open-source toolkit is designed to simplify the management, integration and deployment of AI models for developers. With support for models hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), EMF empowers developers to download, automate and manage AI models locally with ease.

Using the EMF CLI, developers can effortlessly install, update or remove AI models. It generates a Python project scaffolding and, through the EMF SDK, automatically creates ready-to-use classes for the selected models. This enables developers to focus on building their applications without worrying about the complexities of model integration.

Once the application is ready, the EMF CLI streamlines the deployment process, allowing developers to package and deploy their applications seamlessly across multiple platforms.

Whether you're just starting with AI or are an experienced developer, Easy Model Fusion makes AI model management and deployment more accessible than ever. Explore the [documentation](https://easy-model-fusion.github.io/docs/) to get started, contribute, and transform the way we use AI models!
