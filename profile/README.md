# Easy Model Fusion Toolkit

This open-source toolkit aims to enable users to download, automate, manage, and use AI models locally easily.
For now, all models are to be provided by [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).
It also aims to facilitate the packaging and deployment of the app on different platforms.
The main objective of this toolkit is to simplify the use of AI models and their integration.


Feel free to explore and contribute to our toolkit to make AI model management and usage more accessible!
